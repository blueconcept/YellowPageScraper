Founded in 1981 in Atlanta, Georgia, the restaurant began with one man's passion for perfect steak but had very few guests to convince. Then a freak snowstorm hit Atlanta in 1982, stranding motorists and drawing them to one of the only hospitable places available - a restaurant then called LongHorn Steaks Restaurant & Saloon. Tales of expertly grilled steaks soon spread like wildfire, and the legend of LongHorn was born.\n\u00a0\nBy 1990, the restaurant had spread throughout the East, Midwest and Southwest United States and Puerto Rico. In 2007, the restaurant, now called LongHorn Steakhouse, was purchased by Darden Restaurants, Inc.\n\u00a0\nToday, LongHorn welcomes diners to a modern, relaxing dining experience, with knowledgeable servers offering the finest fresh steaks, chicken and seafood expertly prepared as only LongHorn can.\n\u00a0\nBeyond legendary steaks done right, LongHorn is also known for being a positive force in the community. Each day, the restaurant gathers unused, fresh food that wasn't served & donates it to local community food banks. LongHorn Steakhouse is proud to give back to the local community and help make a difference in the lives of others.\n\u00a0", "payment-method": ["amex,", "discover,", "master", "card,", "visa"], "hours": null, "location": null, "aka": null, "categories": ["Restaurants,", "Steak", "Houses,", "Take", "Out", "Restaurants,", "Family", "Style", "Restaurants,", "American", "Restaurants,", "Seafood", "Restaurants"]}, "name": "LongHorn Steakhouse", "locality": null, "website-url": null, "region": null, "id": 122, "street-address": null, "phone-number": null, "postal-code": null}, "123": {"information": {"general-info": "Fresh is in our food: \nEach day, you'll find an updated selection of fresh fish on our Today's Fresh Fish menu, not to mention live Maine lobster, freshly baked Cheddar Bay Biscuits\u2122, crisp salads and a host of fresh seafood recipes waiting to be explored. \nFresh is in our knowledge: \nNo one knows seafood better than we do.
